### Pizza Sales Analysis


### 1. Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the pizza sales data to help a fictional pizza company improve its sales strategy. The analysis includes revenue performance, customer preferences, and operational insights based on the sales data of various pizza types, sizes, and order times. 

The goal of the project is to provide key insights and recommendations that the company can use to enhance its sales, optimize menu offerings, and better target its customer base.

### 2. Project Goals
- Develop essential metrics based on the provided dataset.
- Construct a dashboard following the stakeholder requirements.
- Generate actionable insights that go beyond the predefined metric list and dashboard mockup.

### 3. Import & Explore Data

#### Using SQL to Explore Data
Exploring the data before diving into analysis is key to understanding customer behavior, pizza preferences, and sales patterns.

#### Dataset Overview:
- `dim_pizzas`: This table contains information about the pizza types, their sizes, and base prices.
- `dim_orders`: This table lists the order details such as order IDs, dates, and times.
- `fact_sales`: This fact table includes sales transactions with order IDs, pizza IDs, quantities, and sales amounts.
- `fact_customers`: Contains data on customer IDs, locations, and purchase histories.

### 4. Data Modelling
Data modeling is the foundation of the analysis. In this project, data was modeled using Power BIâ€™s Power Query. The following steps were followed:

- Data cleaning, formatting, and transformation using Power Query.
- Establishing relationships among tables, adopting the Star Schema methodology.
- Validating the data against the metrics provided by stakeholders.
